My first attempt at a React app (coming from Angular). 

# spelling-bee
A simple spelling drill using:-
- Browser voice synthesis (switching to Google Cloud Services soon!)
- React 18
- Three JS
- Ionic 5.x

Enter a spelling list (currently stored in browser local storage only).
Do a spelling drill - words are spoken, with coaching prompts, option to repeat and drill completion.

# To Do
- Adding scoring
- Keep lists in dB
- Proper user profile switching (currently only mock)
- Dynamically create supplmentary drills to work on problem words

# Working Demo (desktop only, as mobile voice synth is not yet supported)
